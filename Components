TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
                           The EVM project utilizes specific tools and technologies to achieve functionality, efficiency, and user interaction. Each component plays a vital role in the project. Below is a detailed explanation of the tools and technologies used and why they are needed.

3.1.1 HARDWARE USE:

                                           The Arduino Uno is a widely used microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P, designed for beginners and professionals in electronics. It operates at 5V with a 16 MHz clock speed, providing reliable performance for various applications. The board features 14 digital I/O pins (6 with PWM capabilities) and 6 analog input pins, enabling it to interface with sensors, actuators, and other devices.
                                        It is programmed using the Arduino IDE, supporting easy coding and uploading via a USB Type-B port. A voltage regulator and power jack allow operation through external power supplies (7-12V recommended). The ICSP header enables advanced programming, while onboard LEDs assist in debugging. Its robust design and open-source ecosystem make it ideal for prototyping, IoT, robotics, and automation projects.
3.1.2 LCD DISPLAY 16X2:
        An LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is an electronic display module that uses liquid crystals to control light for presenting text, symbols, or images. It operates by manipulating light through polarization and backlighting, making it energy-efficient. Commonly used in embedded systems, the most popular type is the 16x2 LCD, which displays 2 rows of 16 characters each. It is controlled by an HD44780 driver, allowing alphanumeric and custom characters. The display requires a 5V or 3.3V power supply and is interfaced with microcontrollers using parallel or I2C communication. A potentiometer adjusts the contrast, while the backlight ensures readability in low light. LCDs are widely used in Arduino projects for user interfaces.

3.1.3 SWITCH
                   In an electronic voting machine (EVM), buttons play a critical role in enabling voters to select their preferred candidate and confirm their choice. Each button corresponds to a specific candidate or option and is designed for durability, reliability, and ease of use. These buttons are typically momentary push buttons, which register an input only when pressed.

3.2.4.Potentiometer
                              The 10k potentiometer in the electronic voting machine adjusts display brightness, volume levels, and sensor input sensitivity. It optimizes the visibility of the interface, enhances user experience with audio feedback, and ensures accurate operation of touch-sensitive buttons. Its inclusion improves usability and functionality, catering to diverse user preferences

3.1.5: Resistor: 
                                      Resistors play crucial roles in various circuitry. They are used for current limiting to protect components from excessive current flow, voltage division to adjust signal levels, and pull-up or pulldown configurations for digital inputs. In voting machines, resistors help regulate voltage levels, control currents, and ensure the proper functioning of electronic components, contributing to the reliability and stability of the system. Additionally, they aid in setting thresholds for sensors, enabling accurate detection of inputs such as button presses or card insertions.

3.1.6 LED 
                            Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that simplifies the creation of interactive projects. It consists of both hardware—such as microcontroller boards like Arduino Uno, Nano, or Mega—and software, primarily the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The platform enables users to write, upload, and run code on the boards to control a variety of components, such as LEDs, sensors, motors, and displays. 
                              Its versatility makes it popular among beginners and professionals for projects ranging from simple blinking LEDs to complex automation and Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Arduino's extensive online community provides abundant resources, tutorials, and libraries, making it accessible and adaptable for countless applications.
